captions_lyricI’m here for a good time not a long timeI can’t really see another squad tryna cross usI’m up right now and you suck right nowNo new friendsWhere you movin’? I said onto better things"Know yourself, know your worth""Make the most out of tonight, and worry ‘bout it all tomorrow""I’m way up, I feel blessed"I cannot see heaven being much better than this"Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight""I’mma sip it ‘til i feel it, I’mma smoke it ‘til it’s done"I still ride with my day oneMy excuse is that I’m youngI live for the nights that I can’t remember with the people that I won’t forget"I’mma worry ‘bout me, give a fuck about you"Nobody really likes us except for us"They ain’t make me what I am, they just found me like this"You only live onceDrinking every night because we drink to my accomplishmentsStarted from the bottom now we’re here"Last name ever, first name greatest"Whole squad on that real shitOn my worst behavior"Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up"Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequenceNever not chasing a million things I want.captions_genericYou think this is a game?"Weekend, please don’t leave me."Don’t let anyone tell you that you’re not strong enough."Be who and what you want, period.""Stay strong, the weekend is coming."You play Call of Duty? That’s cute.You’re doing it wrong."Don’t be like the rest of them, darling.""I wasn’t lucky, I deserved it.""Whatever you do in life, make sure it makes you happy.""The question isn’t can you, it’s will you?"What do you think of the view?"When I feel a little down, I put on my favorite high heels and dance."I liked memes before they were on InstagramThat moment when you realize your childhood is over."Friday, my second favorite F word."I’ll never try to fit in. I was born to STAND OUT.captions_sentimentalNever love anyone who treats you like you’re ordinary.Trying to forget it but the memories are too strong.We all start as strangers."Truth is, I’m crazy for you. And everyone can see that but you.""I act like I’m ok, but I’m really not."Stop looking for happiness in the same place you just lost it."Don’t worry if you haven’t found your true love, they’re just with someone else right now."Never cry for that person who doesn’t know the value of your tears."If I die tomorrow, will you remember me?"Keep smiling because life is a beautiful thing and there’s so much to smile about.Don’t let your eyes be blinded by her beauty."Boys are like purses, cute, full of crap, and can always be replaced."Being single is smarter than being in the wrong relationship.captions_funny"When nothing goes right, go left instead!""I need a six month holiday, twice a year.""There may be no excuse for laziness, but I’m still looking."A blind man walks into a bar… And a chair… and a table."I don’t always surf the internet, but when I do, eyebrows!""Yesterday, I changed my WiFi password to “Hackitifyoucan”; today, someone changed it to “ChallengeAccepted”.""So, you’re on Instagram? You must be an amazing photographer."Real men don’t take selfies.I haven’t done this in a while so excuse me.I know I’m lucky that I’m so cute.Onions make me sad. A lot of people don’t realize that.I’m your worst nightmare."Hey girl, feel my sweater. Know what it’s made of? Boyfriend material.""If I was funny, I would have a good Instagram caption."I think you are lacking vitamin me!"What if I told you, you can eat without posting it on Instagram.""Ladies, please."Need an ark? I Noah guy.
